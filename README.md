Hi Humans!
# Markdown Test Assignment
# It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even link to Google!
** Sometimes you want numbered lists:** 
```
if (is Awesome){
    return true
    }
```
*Italics is often considered very formal*
 Uncle Iroh once said:

This is just a test to make sure that it works properly.
